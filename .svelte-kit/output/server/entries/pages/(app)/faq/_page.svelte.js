		Yes! We hang out at the bike racks before the game.
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		Because we love watching baseball and riding bicycles.
		<h2>Where?</h2>
		At the bike rack near Tailgate Haus. If available, we&#39;ll find a table to share nearby.
		<h2>When?</h2>
		Every first Tuesday Brewers home game. The next ride is May 14th. Here&#39;s the<a href="/schedule">schedule</a>.
		<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
		You, your bike, and a lock.
		<h2>What if I don&#39;t have a bicycle?</h2>
		There is a Bubbler bicycle gate at the start and end of the ride. Learn more at<a href="https://bublrbikes.org/">https://bublrbikes.org/</a> <h2>What about food and drink?</h2>
		BYOB, food, and drinks.
		<h2>What about grilling?</h2>
		Until otherwise only prepared food.
		<h2>I can&#39;t ride my bike today. I&#39;m rooting for the other team. I don&#39;t know anything about
			baseball. I&#39;m new to biking. I won&#39;t know anyone. Is this for me?</h2>
		If the Brew Cruisers tailgate seems like a good time to you, you belong at the Brew Cruisers
		tailgate. If you are made to feel otherwise, please let us know.
		<h2>Do you ride to the tailgate together?</h2>
		Yes! If you&#39;re coming from downtown or east of the ballpark, or you can get there an hour before
		first pitch, ride with us! Otherwise, ride on your own and meet us at the rack.
		<h2>How do I get home?</h2>
		A group of riders will retrace our route back to the starting point. You can also put your bike on
		the red line. If you walk to the end of the platform there&#39;s usually room on the first train.
		Tickets
		<h2>Do you sit together?</h2>
		Yes! We&#39;ll be sitting in section 235 in May. If we arrange a seating area with the Brewers you
		will find a link here. More on that to come.
		<h2>Do I have to sit with you?</h2>
		No! There are other sections available with our ticket link as well, or you can get tickets on
		your own.
		<h2>Where&#39;s the bike parking?</h2>
		Compared to other ballparks there is limited accommodations for bicycles. There are bicycle racks
		in three locations. The Brew Cruisers ride plans to use the rack near the Tailgate Haus. There is
		a rack outside of the right field employee entrance and two surrounding Helfaer Field.
		<h2>Are the racks secure?</h2>
		The racks are within the ballpark premises and are generally patrolled by stadium staff. Similar
		to car tailgaters, bags and tailgate leftovers can be attached to our bikes, but it&#39;s best to
		leave any valuables at home or bring them into the stadium. We recommend you use a good bike lock
		whenever you lock up.
		<h2>What can I bring into the ballpark?</h2>
		Bags small bags (9&quot; x 5&quot;x 2&quot; or smaller) clear totes (12&quot; x 12&quot; x 6&quot; or smaller) diaper bags
		accompanied by a baby medical necessities no backpacks! Food in a clear storage bag no larger than
		1 gallon Water one factory sealed bottle of water we haven&#39;t been turned away with an empty
		soft-plastic bike bottle to fill inside but it&#39;s technically against policy: be prepared to have
		to return it to your bike For more information see the<a href="https://www.mlb.com/brewers/ballpark/security">2024 Brewers Bag Policy</a>
		and list of prohibited items.
		<h2>Is there a place I can check my bag?</h2>
		No. Other ballparks have started accommodating ticket buyers with bag checks, but this service is
		not available at American Family Field. You can leave stuff on your bike or you can bring your
		helmet in and use it as a purse.
		<h2>How long is the ride?</h2>
		Our standard Hank Aaron Trail route is a little less than 4 miles.
		<h2>What&#39;s the pace like?</h2>
		Chill and inclusive! We won&#39;t leave you behind.
		<h2>Where? When?</h2>
		Unless otherwise noted, we meet at the Great Roundabout of Walker&#39;s Point 75 minutes before game
		time and roll out an hour before first pitch. For example on May 14th, meet at 5:25pm to roll out
		at 5:40.
		<h2>What&#39;s the route?</h2>
		Our standard route follows the Hank Aaron Trail on Canal Street.
		<h2>Where can I find more bike rack tailgates?</h2>
		Chicago! The idea for this ride was inspired by the<a href="https://chicagobikesox.com/">https://chicagobikesox.com/</a>.</div>`;
