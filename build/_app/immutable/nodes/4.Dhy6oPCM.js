		Yes! We hang out at the bike racks before the game.
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		Because we love watching baseball and riding bicycles.
		<h2>Where?</h2>
		At the bike rack near Tailgate Haus. If available, we&#39;ll find a table to
		share nearby.
		<h2>When?</h2>
		Every first Tuesday Brewers home game. The next ride is May 14th. Here&#39;s
		the
		<a href="/schedule">schedule</a>.
		<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
		You, your bike, and a lock.
		<h2>What if I don&#39;t have a bicycle?</h2>
		There is a Bubbler bicycle gate at the start and end of the ride. Learn more
		at
		<a href="https://bublrbikes.org/">https://bublrbikes.org/</a> <h2>What about food and drink?</h2>
		BYOB, food, and drinks.
		<h2>What about grilling?</h2>
		Until otherwise only prepared food.
		<h2>I can&#39;t ride my bike today. I&#39;m rooting for the other team. I don&#39;t
			know anything about baseball. I&#39;m new to biking. I won&#39;t know
			anyone. Is this for me?</h2>
		If the Brew Cruisers tailgate seems like a good time to you, you belong at
		the Brew Cruisers tailgate. If you are made to feel otherwise, please let
		us know.
		<h2>Do you ride to the tailgate together?</h2>
		Yes! If you&#39;re coming from downtown or east of the ballpark, or you can get
		there an hour before first pitch, ride with us! Otherwise, ride on your own
		and meet us at the rack.
		<h2>How do I get home?</h2>
		A group of riders will retrace our route back to the starting point. You
		can also put your bike on the red line. If you walk to the end of the platform
		there&#39;s usually room on the first train. Tickets
		<h2>Do you sit together?</h2>
		Yes! We&#39;ll be sitting in section 235 in May. If we arrange a seating area
		with the Brewers you will find a link here. More on that to come.
		<h2>Do I have to sit with you?</h2>
		No! There are other sections available with our ticket link as well, or you
		can get tickets on your own.
		<h2>Where&#39;s the bike parking?</h2>
		Compared to other ballparks there is limited accommodations for bicycles.
		There are bicycle racks in three locations. The Brew Cruisers ride plans
		to use the rack near the Tailgate Haus. There is a rack outside of the right
		field employee entrance and two surrounding Helfaer Field.
		<h2>Are the racks secure?</h2>
		The racks are within the ballpark premises and are generally patrolled by
		stadium staff. Similar to car tailgaters, bags and tailgate leftovers can
		be attached to our bikes, but it&#39;s best to leave any valuables at home or
		bring them into the stadium. We recommend you use a good bike lock whenever
		you lock up.
		<h2>What can I bring into the ballpark?</h2>
		Bags small bags (9&quot; x 5&quot;x 2&quot; or smaller) clear totes (12&quot; x 12&quot; x 6&quot; or smaller)
		diaper bags accompanied by a baby medical necessities no backpacks! Food
		in a clear storage bag no larger than 1 gallon Water one factory sealed bottle
		of water we haven&#39;t been turned away with an empty soft-plastic bike bottle
		to fill inside but it&#39;s technically against policy: be prepared to have to
		return it to your bike For more information see the
		<a href="https://www.mlb.com/brewers/ballpark/security">2024 Brewers Bag Policy</a>
		and list of prohibited items.
		<h2>Is there a place I can check my bag?</h2>
		No. Other ballparks have started accommodating ticket buyers with bag checks,
		but this service is not available at American Family Field. You can leave
		stuff on your bike or you can bring your helmet in and use it as a purse.
		<h2>How long is the ride?</h2>
		Our standard Hank Aaron Trail route is a little less than 4 miles.
		<h2>What&#39;s the pace like?</h2>
		Chill and inclusive! We won&#39;t leave you behind.
		<h2>Where? When?</h2>
		Unless otherwise noted, we meet at the Great Roundabout of Walker&#39;s Point
		75 minutes before game time and roll out an hour before first pitch. For
		example on May 14th, meet at 5:25pm to roll out at 5:40.
		<h2>What&#39;s the route?</h2>
		Our standard route follows the Hank Aaron Trail on Canal Street.
		<h2>Where can I find more bike rack tailgates?</h2>
